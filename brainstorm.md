# Evaluating App Ideas
1. Pomodoro Study App
   - **Description**: Allows people to study and be focused for a strategic amount of time, using the "Pomodoro" method. Scientifically proven to be an efficient and effective way to study.
   - **Category:** Productivity
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is required for this app as it would be intended to study anywhere at anytime. Mobile phones provide that criteria, and would be convenient in long-term. It would make use of real-time and push.
   - **Story:** The value of this app would be received positively as there are many users (such as college students) who could benefit from this idea. In terms of peer review, I believe they would benefit from the idea as well since they are university students.
   - **Market:** This app is designed to target people who do not have a firm structure of studying. The Pomodoro app could be their introduction to an effective study habit.
   - **Habit:** This app would be meant to be used often (whenever studying is needed). It would be something to push in to and leave in the background.
   - **Scope:** The idea of a Pomodoro app is not technically challenging as the coding logic and conceptual idea around it is not difficult. The structure I am planning is clearly defined to make it easy to use for the user.

2. Water Reminder
   - **Description**: Remind users to drink water to stay healthy on a timer.
   - **Category:** health & fitness
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is also required for this app as it would be intended to remind the user anywhere at anytime. It would be based on real-time.
   - **Story:** The value of this app would be received positively as many people often forget to drink a healthy amount of water each day. This can be due to factors such as staying "too focused" or just simply forgetting.
   - **Market:** This app is designed to target people want a healthy lifestyle of being hydrated. It would also encourage users to not drink unhealthy drinks such as Soda.
   - **Habit:** This app would be meant to notify the user on a timely pattern. It would be a background app, and the user would not have to spend too much time on it.
   - **Scope:** The idea of a water reminder app is not technically challenging as the coding logic and conceptual idea around it is not difficult. 

3. Toilet Locator
   - **Description**: Help users find a toilet around them, and possibly look at the best bathrooms available.
   - **Category:** travel, social
   - **Mobile:** Mobile is required for this app as it would be intended to for the user to use it outside. It would point the user in a direction.
   - **Story:** The value of this app would be received positively as many people often do not know where the nearest bathroom is in settings they are not familiar with. 
   - **Market:** This app is designed to target people who need to find a bathroom instantly. It can also be used as a review app (similar to Yelp) where people can leave a review on the bathroom (clean, dirty, etc)
   - **Habit:** This app would be used for when the user does not know where a bathroom is. It is not intended to fit into a user's daily life, and is only there for convenience.
   - **Scope:** The idea of a toilet locator app would be difficult as I would have to utilize the use of geographical APIs to help locate the nearest toilets around the user, which would also be based on location. Furthermore, the idea of adding a review feature would also be difficult.

# Decision
I will be planning to make the Pomodoro App. I have chosen this application because it would be the most useful and scalable app out of the three ideas listed. Furthermore, the idea would be used to benefit many people
