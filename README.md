## Overview

### Description

[Description of your app]

### App Evaluation

[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Productivity
- **Mobile:** Mobile is required for this app as it would be intended to study anywhere at anytime. Mobile phones provide that criteria, and would be convenient in long-term. It would make use of real-time and push.
- **Story:** The value of this app would be received positively as there are many users (such as college students) who could benefit from this idea. In terms of peer review, I believe they would benefit from the idea as well since they are university students.
- **Market:** This app is designed to target people who do not have a firm structure of studying. The Pomodoro app could be their introduction to an effective study habit.
- **Habit:** This app would be meant to be used often (whenever studying is needed). It would be something to push in to and leave in the background.
- **Scope:** The idea of a Pomodoro app is not technically challenging as the coding logic and conceptual idea around it is not difficult. The structure I am planning is clearly defined to make it easy to use for the user.
